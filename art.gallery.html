    <H2>Pablo Picasso</H2>
     <P><i>An artist is a person engaged in creating art, or practicing the arts. <br>
        The most common usage in everyday speech and academic discourse refers to a practitioner in the visual arts only. <br>
        Rembrandt, also known as the Dutch Master, is one of the greatest painters and one of the biggest artists in all history,<br>
         greatly admired for his mastery with which he crafted all his works of art. <br>
         <hr>His paintings are admired for the vivid reality depicted and for the skillful illustration of his subjects’ inner feelings.</hr><br>
          He is particularly known for portraits in which he demonstrated an uncanny ability to evoke the innermost thoughts of his subjects,<br>
           including himself, through the play of facial expression and the fall of light across the sitter’s features.
